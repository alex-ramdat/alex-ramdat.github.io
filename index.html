            </div>
           
            <p>The objective of this project was to create an interactive quiz based on a topic of your choice, mine being Animal Crossing Characters. Based on the choices the user typed in the question boxes, there would be a different result due to the if else statements created in the JavaScript code. I was able to learn how to create various results based on conditional statements and can't wait to experiment with it further in the future.</p>

                         <p>The objective of this project was to create a webpage that allows the user to inout an image link and it would appear on the webpage. I based my webpage around the users favorite art pieces and I got it started by included three of my own favorite art pieces, "The Starry Night", "The Persistence of Time", and "Luncheon on the Grass". I learned how to push images into an array soley based on what the user pastes in the input box.</p>
